Hello! My name is Rylie Forester and I am an undergrad CIS major with a concentration in software, web, and computer security. 

I have experience in Java and C++, with some experience in JavaScript and Linux.

I am an avid reader, enjoy photography, and have a strong passion for drawing and illustration.

Though I am not sure of the specificity of the type of CS career I would like to pursue, I am excited to learn more about the different programming skills 
offered in this class.
